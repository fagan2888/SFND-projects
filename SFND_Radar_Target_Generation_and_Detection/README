### Implementation steps for the 2D CFAR process

### Selection of Training, Guard, and offset

### Steps taken to suppress the non-thresholded cells at the edges

### Target Generation and Detection
1. FMCW waveform configuration

### FMCW Waveform Design
Using the given system requirements, the Bandwidth `B`, chirp time `Tchirp`, and slope of the chirp was found to be `2e13`.

### Simulation Loop
The target movement was simulated. The beat frequency was found for every timestamp.

### Range FFT (1st FFT)
The range FFT was implemented on the beat or mixed signal. The plot is below:

### 2D CFAR
2D CFAR is implemented on the output of the 2D FFT (Range-Doppler map). Notice that the noise is supressed and target signal remains:
