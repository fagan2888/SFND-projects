## Kalman Filters in C++
Tracking problem in physical systems. Motion models, sensor fusion.
We will develop a fusion system to combine measurements from different sensors. For example, we will be tracking a pedestrian using sensor fusion (position, heading, speed)

### Lesson Map and Fusion Flow

Extended Kalman Filter: Handles non-linear motion models. We will use LIDAR + RADAR Data to represent 2D position data of a pedestrian. Remember, RADAR measurement model is non-linear.

### Equations
See reference cheatsheet at [link](../../notes/Kalman-filters/sensor-fusion-ekf-reference.pdf)

### Estimatiion Problem
x: mean state vector, in our example contains  position and velocity
P: state covariance matrix, contains uncertainty of the position and velocity
k: represents time steps
k+1 | k: this notation refers to the prediction step where at k+1 a sensor measurement is received. Before updating the object's position and velocity, we make a prediction step given state at k. 

For multiple asynchronous sensor measurements, just make the prediction/update steps independently. If sensor measurements are received at the same time, just do 2 prediction/update steps (order does not matter). In this case, the prediction step is repeated so we could omit 1 (predict, update, update).

### Programming example
1D Kalman Filter in C++ with Eigen library.
Compiling with:
```
g++ /usr/local/include/eigen3 tracking_1D.cpp
```
