## Kalman Filters in C++
Tracking problem in physical systems. Motion models, sensor fusion.
We will develop a fusion system to combine measurements from different sensors. For example, we will be tracking a pedestrian using sensor fusion (position, heading, speed)

### Lesson Map and Fusion Flow

Extended Kalman Filter: Handles non-linear motion models. We will use LIDAR + RADAR Data to represent 2D position data of a pedestrian. Remember, RADAR measurement model is non-linear.

### Equations
See reference cheatsheet at [link](../../notes/Kalman-filters/sensor-fusion-ekf-reference.pdf)

### Estimatiion Problem
x: mean state vector, in our example contains  position and velocity
P: state covariance matrix, contains uncertainty of the position and velocity
k: represents time steps
k+1 | k: this notation refers to the prediction step where at k+1 a sensor measurement is received. Before updating the object's position and velocity, we make a prediction step given state at k. 

For multiple asynchronous sensor measurements, just make the prediction/update steps independently. If sensor measurements are received at the same time, just do 2 prediction/update steps (order does not matter). In this case, the prediction step is repeated so we could omit 1 (predict, update, update).

### Programming example
1D Kalman Filter in C++ with Eigen library.
Compiling with:
```
g++ /usr/local/include/eigen3 tracking_1D.cpp
```

### State prediction
Consider 2D position and 2D velocity. Let $$ x = \bmatrix(p_x p_y v_x v_y} $$. We can use the linear motion model:
```
p_x' = p_x + v_x*dt + nu_px
p_y' = p_y + v_y*dt + nu_py
v_x' = v_x + nu_vx
v_y' = v_y + nu_vy
```
We can find F from this since we know x' = Fx + noise. Remember, this is a constant velocity model though we know in reality the velocity can change based on acceleration. This acceleration is modeled as process noise.

### Process Covariance Matrix
How do we choose the values of \sigma_ax^2 and \sigma_ay^2? For this example, we know that acceleration is being modeled as a process noise. That means we can analytically derive an expression for Q.

The Q matrix would include `dt` to account for the fact that as more time passes, we become more uncertain about the position/velocity.
```
Q = [dt^4/4 * sigma2_ax, 0, dt^3/2 * sigma2_ax, 0; 0, dt^4/4 * sigma2_ay, 0, dt^3/2 * sigma2_ax; dt^3/2 * sigma2_ax, 0, dt^2 * sigma2_ax, 0; 0; dt^3/2 * sigma^2_ay; 0; dt^2 * sigma2_ay ]
```
The random acceleration vector nu would be nu = [nu_px; nu_py; nu_vx; nu_vy]
```
nu_px = a_x*dt^2/2
nu_py = a_y*dt^2/2
nu_vx = a_x*dt
nu_vy = a_y*dt
```
An alternative way to represent nu is decomposing it into 2 matrices. A 4x2 matrix G and a 2x1 matrix a. This separates the random variables.
```
G = [dt^2/2, 0; 0, dt^2/2; dt, 0; 0, dt];
a = [a_x; a_y];
```
Note: Q_nu is a 2x2 covariance matrix of the individual process noise. Q is G * Q_nu * G^T

## Measurement Model
For a LIDAR, `z = Hx` where `z = [px, py]`
